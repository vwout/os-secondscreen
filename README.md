# os-secondscreen
os-secondscreen is an in-browser second screen for [OpenSong](http://opensong.org). It shows the slide that is currently presented full-screen in a browser. It can be used to easily setup an additional display using a computer, tablet or TV in combination with e.g. a Chromecast.

The OpenSong Second Screen app is a readonly client for the [OpenSong API](http://opensong.org/pages/api.html). It uses a websocket connection to OpenSong. It can not be used as a remote control for OpenSong.

The features are:
- display of the current slide as image
- display of lyrics and verses including chords using [opensong.js](https://github.com/deepflame/opensong.js)
- display of the body text of the current slide moved to the bottom of the screen with a green background to be used as a chroma overlay for videos.
